# Changelog

All notable changes to `@catheadowl/dsh-eval` are documented here. Versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); entries follow
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) conventions.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING (0.x minor)**: public API split into two tiers. The root entry
  is now the SDK tier only (assertion DSL, step builders, `runEvalCase`,
  `defineReviewExperiment`); low-level sandbox/overlay/trace primitives and
  review execution moved to the `./experimental` escape-hatch subpath.
- `exports` map added — deep path imports are now mechanically blocked.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-05

### Added

- Initial public release: case runner over dsh headless runs,
  session-trace assertions, and a scripted mock-LLM layer for plugin intent
  tests.
- CLI binaries `dsh-eval` (run cases) and `dsh-review` (LLM output review);
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm` is a peerDependency provided by the host
  ecosystem.
